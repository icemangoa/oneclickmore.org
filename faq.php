          <h2><strong>Will I pay more if I buy through One Click More?</strong></h2>
          <p>No. The price of your order through One Click More is exactly the same as if you had gone to the store directly. The donation amount stems from the marketing fee paid by the e-shop to One Click More.</p>

          <p>One Click More receives a commission on all purchases made through its website. This fee is paid by the shop to One Click More for sending the customer. 75% of this amount is  donated to the charity of your choice and the remaining 25% is kept by us for operational costs and wages.</p>
