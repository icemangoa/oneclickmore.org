A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqRoRK.

 More content or navigation can be displayed off-canvas above the core content.

Pros
- Saves space for core content.
- Elegant

Cons
- JS Dependency - Not necessarily a con, but ensure that off-canvas content is still accessible for users with poor/no JS support
- Animation Performance - Platforms, especially mobile platforms, vary greatly in how well they treat animations. Keep this in mind.
