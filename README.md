# oneclickmore.org
OneClickMore.org is a charity platform which aims to help non-profit organizations with monetary assistance.

A simply made web site which uses Angular JS to manage the variables. 

A user selects an eshop from the list (either to book a ticket, to buy clothes, shoes or books), then selects the cause to which he wants the commision given from his purchase to be attributed to and OneClickMore.org redirects him there keeping his selection on the URL.

All the redirections and the sales are monitored through Google Analytics so that each cause representative can easily see the progress of his campaign and know how much money to expect.

The files are available to be downloaded and used by people alike minded. The purpose of this project is solely humanitarian.

I've used this code on ModX Revolution cms to set up the page > www.oneclickmore.org

Any help or suggestion to improve the code is more than welcome. Together we can try and beautify this world.
